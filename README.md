My journey as an analytics professional has been marked with an unabating pursuit of excellence and a desire to formulate actionable insights from data-driven processes. Supplied with a B.S. in Computer Science and minor in Economics from Georgia Tech, I have developed a strong ability to tackle complex challenges and create impactful solutions that drive business success. 

Currently, I am pursuing a M.S. in Analytics at Georgia Tech and working as a Software Engineer I at Trawick International. 

Previous professional experiences and projects include:

Actuarial Factor: Streamlined loss reserving processes by 50% by transitioning previous excel based workflows to a Python-driven system, leveraging Numpy and Pandas analytics libraries. 

Assurant: Developed a Power BI dashboard summarizing tasks for the Global Analytics Department, optimized load times by 40% by using SQL-based solutions. 

I am passionate about the intersection between technology and finance. Whether it's leveraging AI for business or working on insurance-related finance projects, I am constantly striving to learn more in these fields. Beyond analytics, I enjoy marathon running, soccer, and chess in my free time.
